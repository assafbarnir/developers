<p>The Qordoba connector acts as stand-alone service and can will Subscribers/Publishes to <strong>any configurable MQTT topic.</strong> 
In the tables below, you can view which parameters you can use to customize your configuration with this particular system:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`Broker URI`	The URI to use to connect to the MQTT broker (e.g. tcp://localhost:1883). The 'tcp' and 'ssl' schemes are supported. In order to use 'ssl', the SSL Context Service property must be set.
`Client ID`	MQTT client ID to use
`Username`	Username to use when connecting to the broker
`Password`	Password to use when connecting to the broker
`SSL Context Service`	The SSL Context Service used to provide client certificate information for TLS/SSL connections.
`Last Will Topic` The topic to send the client Last Will to. If the Last Will topic and message are not set then a Last Will will not be sent.
`Last Will Message`	The message to send as the client Last Will. If the Last Will topic and message are not set then a Last Will will not be sent.
`Last Will Retain`	Whether to retain the client Last Will. If the Last Will topic and message are not set then a Last Will will not be sent.
`Last Will QoS Level` QoS level to be used when publishing the Last Will Message
`Session State`	Whether to start afresh or resume previous flows. #value is true or false
`Connection Timeout`	Maximum time interval the client will wait for the network connection to the MQTT server to be established. The default timeout is 30 seconds. A value of 0 disables timeout processing meaning the client will wait until the network connection is made successfully or fails.
`Keep Alive Interval` Defines the maximum time interval between messages sent or received. It enables the client to detect if the server is no longer available, without having to wait for the TCP/IP timeout. The client will ensure that at least one message travels across the network within each keep alive period. In the absence of a data-related message during the time period, the client sends a very small "ping" message, which the server will acknowledge. A value of 0 disables keepalive processing in the client.
`Topic Filter`	The MQTT topic filter to designate the topics to subscribe to.
`Quality of Service (QoS)` The Quality of Service(QoS) to receive the message with. Accepts values '0', '1' or '2'; '0' for 'at most once', '1' for 'at least once', '2' for 'exactly once'.
`Max Queue Size`	The MQTT messages are always being sent to subscribers on a topic. If the 'Run Schedule' is significantly behind the rate at which the messages are arriving to this processor then a back up can occur. This property specifies the maximum number of messages this processor will hold in memory at one time.

Expression language is allowed in order to support publishing messages with different QoS but the end value of the property must be either '0', '1' or '2'. 
`Retain Message`	Whether or not the retain flag should be set on the MQTT message.
