#What level of permission do I select for my new user?

When you add new users to Qordoba, you have the ability to assign the person a specific set of permissions. Qordoba has 3 default permissions:

  - Owner
  - Full Access
  - Restricted Access

Qordoba also gives you the ability to create custom user permission roles to fit your company's needs and workflow.


###Owner

The owner is the administrator of the account. This person will have the ability to:

  - View and create reports
  - View all, create new and delete workspace content and workspace
  - Invite and remove users
  - Manage and create new user permissions
  - Manage and create workflows
  - Setup and manage Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - Manage billing

You can more than one owner in the account. Only owners will be able to designate other owners.


###Full Access

A full access user has the same permissions as the owner, but will not have the ability to delete workspaces/content, access organization settings, or billing. 

The owner can designate access full access to specific workspaces or to all workspaces. Full access users are generally an employee of your company.


###Restricted Access 

A restricted access user will only have access to workspaces they have been added to. They cannot invite users or create workspaces. Restricted users are typically freelancers that have been added to help translate some of the content.
