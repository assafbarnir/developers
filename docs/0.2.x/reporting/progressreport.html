<p>###How to read your Workspace Progress Report</p>

<p>To learn how to read your Workspace Progress Report, let’s use the example from Company ABC below.</p>

<p>At the top of the report, you’ll see a summary of the entire workspace and a button to export the report into a .xlsx file. The report consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All workflow steps and locales in the workspace</li>
  <li>Total number of words and segments for each workflow step in the workspace</li>
  <li>Total number of words and segments for each workflow step by locale</li>
</ul>

<p>To get the details for each locale, you can select from the “Persona” drop-down or click on the name of the locale.</p>

<p>In the example below, Company ABC’s progress for their Spanish-Spain locale is nearing completion with 72% of their words in “Complete” status. Since they can see which specific file is in progress or not been touched by their team members, they can easily access the file by clicking on the name and reach out to the responsible team member.</p>

<p>They can easily reach out by commenting or sending a direct message to the team member.</p>
