<p>#Can I automate my workflows within Qordoba?</p>

<p>Yes. Qordoba’s Automations are a combination of rules and actions that are defined between two workflow steps.</p>

<p>Automations help to improve the speed, efficiency, and performance of your localization processes.</p>

<p>To create a new Automation, head to the “Workflow” tab on the left-hand sidebar of your project in Qordoba and click on “Automations.”</p>

<p>Click “Add New Automation” and name your Automation.</p>

<p>Then, specify between which workflow steps you would like your Automation to apply. Please note that our automations always move forwards, not backwards, to prevent an infinite loop of data.</p>

<p>Our automations are comprised of “if, then” statements, defined as <strong>Rules</strong> and <strong>Actions</strong>.</p>

<p>To customize your <strong>Rules</strong>, you first set the boundaries of your rules by specifying if “all” or “any” of your rules apply.</p>

<p>Then, select from the following dropdowns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SmartSuggest match rate</strong> is [greater or equal to], [less or equal to], [greater than], [less than], or [is] a percentage you specify</li>
  <li><strong>Target language</strong> is [one of] one or more languages that you specify</li>
  <li>Pushed by [one of] any number of members on your team</li>
  <li><strong>CM match</strong> is [greater or equal to], [less or equal to], [greater than], [less than], or [is] a percentage you specify</li>
  <li><strong>CM key match</strong> is [greater or equal to], [less or equal to], [greater than], [less than], or [is] a percentage you specify</li>
</ul>

<p>You can combine any number of rules within the <strong>Rules</strong> section.</p>

<p>To customize your <strong>Actions</strong>, select from the following dropdown:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Push SmartSuggest</strong> through the workflow step you defined</li>
  <li><strong>Save CM</strong> at the workflow step you defined (note: the TM will be matched by source)</li>
  <li><strong>Push CM</strong> through the workflow step you defined (note: the TM will be matched by source)</li>
  <li><strong>Push target segment</strong> through the workflow step you defined</li>
  <li><strong>Save target segment</strong> at the workflow step you defined</li>
  <li><strong>Save CM (key first)</strong> at the workflow step you defined (note: the TM will be matched by key)</li>
  <li><strong>Push CM (key first)</strong> through the workflow step you defined (note: the TM will be matched by key)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can compound both “move to” and “save at” actions.</p>

<p><strong>Example Automations:</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of this article, we will assume a 5-step workflow consisting of Development, PM Review, Translation, Editing, and Final Review.</p>

<p>If I want to automatically push all 100% Translation Memory matches from Development to Final Review, bypassing the PM Review, Translation, and Editing steps, I would create the rule as follows below:</p>

<p>If I want to further whittle this automation down to target only my Korean segments, I will add a second rule to my automation:</p>

<p>If I want to push all segments that are 100% matches based on key, I would create the following automation:</p>

<p>If I want to push all segments pushed by my PM in the PM Review step to Final Review, I can create this automation rule:</p>

<p><strong>insert image here</strong></p>

<p>If I want to save all Korean segments that are 100% Translation Memory matches at the PM Review step, I will create the following automation below:</p>

<p>To view a list of all of your automations, head back to the Automations section within the Workflow tab.</p>

<p>You can edit, duplicate, make inactive (or active), or delete your Automations by clicking on the gear icon at the right of the Automation.</p>
