<p>#How do I link a new content memory to an existing workspace?</p>

<p>If you have Full Access permissions, go the the workspace and click on “Settings” in the left hand navigation bar in Qordoba. Click on the gear icon to the right of the persona you want to update. Dropdowns will appear under “Content Memory” and “Terms Bank,” and you will be able to select your new CM from the dropdown to link to the workspace.</p>

<p>If unsaved segments in the existing project are a 100% CM match, Qordoba will replace the existing SmartSuggest translations with what is in the new CM.</p>
