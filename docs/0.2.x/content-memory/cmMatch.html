<p>#How do I know if a segment has a content memory match?</p>

<p>To find out if a segment has a content memory (CM) match, you will need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Hover of the segment and check to see if SmartSuggest appears at 100%.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double click on the segment and look to the right sidebar.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the side bar, you will see the CM match if there is one available. The % match indicates how close of a match the source content is to the the on in the CM.</p>

<p>In the example below, the source content is “Amazon Web Services (AWS)” and there is a 75% Match in the CM with “Amazon Web Services.”</p>
