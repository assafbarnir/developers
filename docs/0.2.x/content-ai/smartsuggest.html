<p>#All About SmartSuggest</p>

<p>SmartSuggest is Qordoba’s proprietary technology. It fuses machine learning with real-life translation activity to provide you and your linguists with recommended content for your target personas. It is replete with confidence levels associated with each segment.</p>

<p>So how does it work?</p>

<p>If have an existing Content Memory in your organization and have linked it to the workspace you currently working in, you will see a SmartSuggest percentage rating to the left of the string. If the string was previously translated and had been saved in the Content Memory, you’ll see a SmartSuggest confidence rating as 100%</p>

<p>If the string does not have an exact source match in the Content Memory, the SmartSuggest confidence will be based on our machine translation technology. The higher the percentage, the more confident Qordoba’s SmartSuggest is recommending the correct translation.</p>

<p>This number will fluctuate based on real-world actions performed by your linguists. As your linguist work in Qordoba, SmartSuggest adapts to the changes that are made and refines its recommendations over time for future translations.</p>

<p>Why do I see SmartSuggest less than 100% when the content was previously translated?</p>

<p>SmartSuggest scans and analyzes the source within your Content Memory. If there are are slight differences in the Content Memory source, it will reduce its confidence rating.</p>

<p>For example, if your source in the Content Memory contains a period and your new content does not, it will reduce it’s SmartSuggest confidence rating slightly.</p>
