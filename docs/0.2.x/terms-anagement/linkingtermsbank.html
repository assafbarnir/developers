<p>#How do I link an existing workspace to an existing terms bank?</p>

<p>If you have Full Access permissions, head to the Settings tab in the left hand navigation bar in Qordoba.

<p>If unsaved segments in the existing workspace have terms that exist in the new terms bank, Qordoba will replace the existing SmartSuggest translations with what is in the new terms bank.</p>

<p>#How do I link a terms bank to a new workspace I’m creating?</p>

<p>During workspace creation, you will need to designate a terms bank for each target persona that you add to workspace. If you have an existing terms bank, it will appear in the drop-down.</p>

<p>If you do not, you will need to create a new terms bank for the target persona. Click on “Create new” to the right of the drop-down.</p>
