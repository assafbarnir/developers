  <center><strong>Qordoba’s SOC 2 Type II compliance is proof of our commitment to security and data integrity throughout our operations and services.</strong></center>
</div>

<p>As companies increasingly use outside vendors to perform activities that are core to their business operations and strategy, there is a need for more trust and transparency into cloud software providers’ operations, processes and results.</p>

<p>The Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 verifies that Qordoba passed a rigorous audit of its internal controls, meeting the security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy standards set by American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). And beyond Type I compliance, Type II compliance means Qordoba passed an audit of our procedures/ controls over a period of 6 months.</p>

<h4 id="what-does-this-mean-for-your-business">What does this mean for your business?</h4>

<p>Along with the added rigor that SOC 2 requires, our SOC 2 Type II compliance means that you can communicate to your customers that your realtime app is built on a SOC 2 compliant infrastructure.</p>

<p>In addition to SOC 2 compliance, Qordoba has developed and maintains a suite of audited processes that reinforce the security of our service delivery environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Encryption (in transit and at rest)</li>
  <li>HIPAA Compliance</li>
  <li>EU and US only Storage when required for PII data</li>
  <li>Intelligent Data Routing to lock and/or block data streams to specific regions</li>
  <li>US-EU Privacy Shield Framework Certified</li>
  <li>Compliance with the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (aka ‘Model Clauses’)</li>
</ul>
