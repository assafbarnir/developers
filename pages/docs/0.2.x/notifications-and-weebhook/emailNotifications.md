#How do I turn on or off my email notifications?

To turn on or off your email notifications, head to your initials at the top right of the Qordoba dashboard and select “Profile” from the dropdown. On the left sidebar, click “Email Notifications” then select "On" or "Off."

If you turn off email notifications, you will not receive emails that will inform you when new segments are available in your assigned workflow step.
