#How is the % confidence interval calculated?

SmartSuggest's confidence interval is determined by an algorithm that is informed by machine learning and real-life translation activity.

If a Content Memory is linked to your workspace, and if a segment youâ€™re translating appears in the Content Memory, your SmartSuggest confidence interval will read 100%.

If the segment in question does not appear in your Content Memory, the confidence interval will initially be based on our machine translation technology. This number will fluctuate based on real-world actions performed by you and your fellow linguists. Was the translation saved or pushed? If so, the confidence interval will increase. Was the translation deleted or modified? If so, the confidence interval will decrease. All the while, our machine learning engine will be refining its recommendations for future translations.
