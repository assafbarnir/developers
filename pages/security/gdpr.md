</div>

As companies extend their reach globally they must comply with global legal frameworks like GDPR.

#### What does this mean for your business? 

Along with the added rigor that GDPR requires, our GDPR compliance means that you can communicate to your customers that your realtime app is built on GDPR compliant infrastructure.

Qordoba has developed and maintains a suite of audited processes that reinforce the security of our service delivery environment:

- Data Encryption (in transit and at rest)
- HIPAA Compliance
- EU and US only Storage when required for PII data
- Intelligent Data Routing to lock and/or block data streams to specific regions
- US-EU Privacy Shield Framework Certified
- Compliance with the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (aka ‘Model Clauses’)
