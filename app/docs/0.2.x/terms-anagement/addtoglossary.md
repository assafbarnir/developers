title: Add Glossary Terms to the Terms Bank

#What is a glossary and how should I use it?

A glossary is a reference tool in which you want to have terms translated in a specific way. However, there may be circumstances in which do not want to be translated in that way due to the context of the sentence. 

For example, let's use the word "Amazon." Amazon is a name of the largest tropical rainforest in the world and also the name of one the largest e-commerce stores. When translating "Amazon" when referring to the company, it will likely remain as "Amazon." However when referring to the name of the rainforest, "Amazon" is likely translated.

By adding "Amazon" to the glossary, the word will now be underlined in purple and will give a visual indication to your linguist to take a section to check the glossary for further instructions on when to translate "Amazon." 

#How do I add terms to an existing glssary?

If you have Full Admin permissions, you can add to a glossary terms bank in 3 ways:

  1. One-by-one: Add individual terms by entering the glossary within the terms bank and clicking “Actions." Select "Add new term." Enter the source term and its target translation.

  2. In bulk: Bulk-add segments by entering the glossary and clicking on the “Actions” dropdown and clicking on “Bulk Add.” Drag and drop the file (CSV, XLSX, TMX, XLIFF) into Qordoba to add to the existing glossary.

  3. On the fly: Highlight the term in the Content Editor and clicking "Add to Term Bank." This will add a purple underline to the term to signify its addition to the glossary. Whenever the term appears again in a workspace linked to the glossary, the term will be underlined and your translation team will be able to copy the glossary translation directly into the target text box.
