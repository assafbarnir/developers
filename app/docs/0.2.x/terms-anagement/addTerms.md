#How do I add terms to an existing Terms Bank?

If you have Full Admin permissions, you can add to a terms bank in 3 ways:

  1. One-by-one: Add individual terms by entering the glossary within the terms bank and clicking “Actions." Select "Add new term." Enter the source term and its target translation.

  2. In bulk: Bulk-add segments by entering the glossary and clicking on the “Actions” dropdown and clicking on “Bulk Add.” Drag and drop the file (CSV, XLSX, TMX, XLIFF) into Qordoba to add to the existing glossary.

  3. On the fly: Highlight the term in the Content Editor and clicking "Add to Glossary." This will add a blue underline to the term to signify its addition to the glossary. Whenever the term appears again in a workspace linked to the glossary, the term will be underlined and your translation team will be able to copy the glossary translation directly into the target text box.
