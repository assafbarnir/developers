title: Linking Terms Bank

#How do I link a workspace to a new terms bank?

If you have Full Access permissions, head to the Settings tab in the left hand navigation bar in Qordoba. To the rigth of the persona you’d like to link the new translation memory, clear the gear icon. A drop-downs will appear under “Terms Bank” and you will be able to select your new terms bank from the dropdown to link to the workspace.

If unsaved segments in the existing workspace have terms that exist in the new terms bank, Qordoba will replace the existing SmartSuggest translations with what is in the new terms bank.
