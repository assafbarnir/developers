# Introducing Qordoba Term Management

Before you use the system, it is important to understand some key concepts in the Qordoba approach to Term management.

The Term Management component of Qordoba is a complete terminology solution. Using the sophisticated Natural Language Processing technologies in Qordoba supports the discovery, validation and use of terminology throughout your organization â€“ supporting writers, editors, and translators.

- `Banned Words`: If Qordoba finds a word that violates the styleguide, it says you can't use it and optionally a description as to why. *looks at target
- `Common Mistakes`: Define common mistakes and the correction to offer. This is a many-to-one relationship meaning you can add multiple variations of a common mistake with a single corrected target.  *looks at target
