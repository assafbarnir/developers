# How do I add a new persona to an existing workspace?


If your clients are requesting a new persona or you're expanding into a new market, you can easily add a new persona to an existing workspace.

Make sure that you have the following before proceeding:

  - Permissions: Full access or have a custom role with "Workspace settings" enabled

To add a persona to an existing workspace:

  1. Open a workspace in Qordoba and click on "Settings" on the left navigation sidebar.

  2. Under the "Workspace personas" section, scroll down and click on "Add persona." Select a new target language by typing or scrolling in the drop-down field.

  3. Select an existing content memory (CM) and Term Bank.
    - If you need a new TM or Term Bank, click on "Create new."

  4. Click on "Update settings."

A new persona has now been added to your workspace. The same workflow and any automation for the workspace will also be automatically applied to the new persona.
