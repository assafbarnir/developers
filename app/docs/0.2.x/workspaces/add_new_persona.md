#How do I add a new persona to an existing workspace?

If your clients are requesting a new persona or you're expanding into a new market, you can easily add a new persona to an existing workspace.

Make sure that you have the following before proceeding:

  - Permissions: Full access or have a custom role with "Workspace settings" enabled

To add a persona to an existing workspace:

1. Open a workspace in Qordoba and click on "Settings" on the left navigation sidebar.

2. Under the "Translation options" tab, scroll down and click on "Add Persona." Select a new target persona by typing or scrolling in the drop-down field.

3. Select an existing content memory (CM) and term bank.
  - If you need a new CM or term bank, click on "Create new."

4. Click on "Update settings."

A new persona has now been added to your workspace. The same workflow and any automation for the workspace will also be automatically applied to the new persona.
