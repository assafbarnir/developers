# What does it mean to publish, unpublish, enable, or disable a page in Qordoba?


**Publishing a page** in Qordoba pushes translated content live to the localized pages of your website. A published page is identified by a checkmark under “Page Status” in your project’s content root.

Completing a page via the translation workflow automatically publishes the page.

You can manually publish a page by selecting the page and clicking “Publish” from the “Actions” dropdown. This will publish the latest version of your content to your localized page.

If the page is already published and you are publishing new content for the same page, you can click “Republish” from the “Actions” dropdown.

**Unpublishing your localized page** renders it inaccessible on your website. Visitors to the page will see a 404 error.

To unpublish a page, select your desired page from the Content Root and select “Unpublish” from the “Actions” dropdown.

**Disabling a page** makes the content inaccessible within Qordoba. A disabled page can still be published, but its content cannot be modified unless it is re-enabled.
