# How do I search and replace?

If you are working within a Strings project, you can use Qordoba's advanced search and replace tool.

To perform Advanced Search within Qordoba, use the "ctrl-f" (Windows) or "command-f" (Mac) shortcut to open Qordoba's Advanced Search and Replace tool.

With Advanced Search and Replace, you can search for content that:

  - appears in the source, target, source & target, or key

**insert image here**

  - "contains," "begins with," "ends with," or "is" a certain search term
  
**insert image here**

To replace terms in the source, target, or source and target, click on the "Search and Replace" link to replace your search term with your desired term.
