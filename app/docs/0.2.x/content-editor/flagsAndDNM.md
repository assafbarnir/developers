title: Do Not Modify + Flags

# Can I lock a string and prevent it from being translated?

Yes! If you are a Full Access user in Qordoba, you are able to set certain segments as “Do Not Modify.” This prevents the string from being translated by any linguist in your project.

  1. Open your workspace and file the string is located in.

  2. Select the string by clicking on the check box.

  3. Click on "More" and select "Do not modify."

  4. If you do not want the string to be modified for a specific language, select "Set for current persona only." If you want to not modify across all languages, select "Set for all target personas."

Once you select a segment as “Do Not Modify,” you will see a "DO NOT MODIFY" label above the string.

 # What is a flag and how does it work?
 
 A "flag" in Qordoba allows you to tag or highlight a segment that you want to revisit at a later time.

A good example of when to use a "flag" is when you are waiting for clarification on a specific segment, but you want an easy way to remember the specific segment. In the example below, 3 segments are flagged and are easily found by applying a filter.

To flag a segment:

  1. Find the segment you want to flag and hover to the left. 

  2. When the flag outline appears, click on the flag to flag the segment.

  3. Repeat for all segments you would like to flag.
  
To find a flagged segment:

  1. Open a workspace and select the file.

  2. Click on "Filter" and select "Flagged."
  
To remove a flag:

  1. Find the segment you want to unflag and hover to the left.

  2. When the flag outline appears, click on the flag to unflag the segment.

  3. Repeat for all segments you would like to unflag.
  
Please note that the flags are only visible to the person who flagged the segment.
