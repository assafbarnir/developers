# How do I edit content I've already pushed?

If you pushed a segment too early or just change your mind about a segment you've already pushed to the next workflow step, you can send a segment back to the previous step for re-editing.

If that option does not appear in your More Actions menu, it means you don't have permissions for editing segments at the next workflow step. In that case, you can request your editor to release that segment by @ mentioning them in the Comments section. 

Once it is pushed back to your workflow step, it will appear in the Content Editor under your workflow step with the status of New.

You can find out who is on your linguist team via the Team module in the Content Editor - helpful for knowing who to message to release the segment!
