# How do files get completed in Qordoba?

Qordoba gives you the flexibility on creating as many, or little, workflow steps to meet your organization needs. Even with a highly customized workflow, the general process of completing files remain the same.

Once your content has gone through all the workflow steps your file will be marked as "Completed." Your file is now ready for be downloaded or pulled back into your tools via one of our many integrations with the finalized translations. 

## How do I push content to the next workflow step?

If you are the linguist or reviewer and you are not in the last workflow step, you will need to push the segments into the next workflow step when you have finished your work. To do so, please use the next steps:

  1. Select specific segments or use the "Select all" box. 

    - If you use the "Select all" box, a message will appear at the top. Click on "Select all ___ segments through pagination" to select all segments beyond the first 50.

    - If you use the "Select all" box, a message will appear at the top. Click on "Select all ___ segments through pagination" to select all segments beyond the first 50.

## What if I need the segment to be revised?

There are couple of different ways to do this:

  - You can click on the target yourself and revise it directly OR
  - Send it back to the previous previous workflow step for revision.
  
If you want to do it yourself, click on the target and make the necessary revisions. Depending on workflow step you're on, you can either push or mark them as complete using the previous steps above.

If you would like to push the segment back to be revised, do the following:

  1. Select the segments you would like to push back. 
  2. Click on "More" and select "Send back to ____." (The name of the previous workflow step will appear.)
