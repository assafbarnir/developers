**Persona Switcher:** Toggle between the different locales that are in the workspace. You will only be able to modify segments in the locale to which you have been assigned. 

**Workflow Step Switcher:** Toggle across the workflow steps in the workspace. If you have modify permissions across a number of workflow steps, you'll also be able to modify segments there. 

**Side Panel Open/Close:** Close the side panel for larger segment editing area. The default contents of the side panel display the following:

  1. File Info:

    - Current Workflow Step
    - The date the selected file was added
    - Names of other team members and the workflow steps to which they are assigned 

  2. Grammar: 
  
    - Grammar issues picked up by Qordoba. Click the check mark to approve suggested change or the x to ignore
  
**Segment Filters:** Filter the segments within the selected workflow step by:

  - Saved: Segments that have been saved by a user 
  - New: Segments that have not been saved
  - Flagged: Segments that have been flagged by a user
  - Pushed: Segments that have been moved to the next workflow step
  - Completed: Segments that have been finalized across all workflow steps 
  - Do Not Modify: Segments that have been marked as "Do Not Modify" by the project owner
  - Repeated only: Segments that are repeated across all of the files of the project 
  - With Comments: Segments on which you or other users have added comments 
  - No Source: Segments that do not contain a source

**More Actions:** Apply the following actions across one or multiple selected segments:

  - Add a flag
  - Mark as "Do Not Modify" 
  - Add a comment

Advanced Search and Replace: Search source segments, target segments, or both for a specific term or keyword. You can also replace single matches or all instances where your query occurs.
