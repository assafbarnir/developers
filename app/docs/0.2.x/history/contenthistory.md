#How does Qordoba track segment history?

Qordoba tracks segment history for **saved or pushed** content in the "History" tab of your workspace. You can see:

  - The changed segments' ID
  - The date on which the segment was updated
  - What the change consisted of, and
  - Who changed the string

The target and the source will be listed side-by-side for comparison, with additions highlighted in green and the deletions marked with a strikethrough.
