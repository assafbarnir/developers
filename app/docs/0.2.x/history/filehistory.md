#How does Qordoba track file history?

Qordoba tracks file history in the "History" tab of your Strings project. You can see the date on which a file was updated, the user that made the update, the number of total strings in the file, and the number of strings changed (new, updated, and deleted)


Click on "History" in the lefthand sidebar of your project.

Then, click on the "File History" tab at the top right.

You can filter by file, and also by user(s).
