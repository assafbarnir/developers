#All About Smart Suggest

Smart Suggest is Qordoba’s proprietary technology. It fuses machine learning with real-life translation activity to provide you and your linguists with recommended content for your target languages. It is replete with confidence levels associated with each segment.


So how does it work?

 
If you upload a Content Memory to your organization and a segment you’re translating appears in the Content Memory, your Smart Suggest confidence interval will read 100%.

If the segment in question does not appear in your Content Memory, the Confidence Interval will initially be based on our machine translation technology. This number will fluctuate based on real-world actions performed by your linguists. Was the translation saved or pushed by a linguist? If so, the confidence interval will increase. Was the translation deleted or modified by another linguist? If so, the confidence interval will decrease. All the while, our machine learning engine will be refining its recommendations for future translations.

Let’s visit one more example. Let’s say that you have two linguists and each of them translated the same segment in a different way. How can you tell what is the correct translation? Smart Suggest will use the content history to find the best option and provide the best possible translation to you.


Smart Suggest is just that - an informed recommendation intended to serve as a guide or a benchmark. It will continue to get smarter as you continue to translate content for your app, website, or other project.
