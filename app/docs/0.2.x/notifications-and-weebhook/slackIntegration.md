#Integrating Qordoba into your Slack account

If you use Slack, you can also easily get notifications into a public or private Slack channel.

  1. Create an incoming webhook in Slack using these instructions. Name the webhook, "Qordoba-Webhook". Do not close out of this page. You will need to copy the webhook URL in Step 6.  

  2. In Qordoba, click on your profile picture and select "Setting."

  3. Click on "Webhooks" or "Slack Webhook." This will change depending on your permission role in Qordoba.

  4. Click on "Add webhook" and then select the following:
    - Event type: An activity you want to see the notification for
    - Project: Select all projects or specific projects

  5. For "Format," select "Slack."

  6. Paste the webhook URL from Slack into "Website URL."

  7. Repeat Steps 3 - 6 for each event type.
