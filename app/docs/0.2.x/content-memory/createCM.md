#What is a Content Memory?

A Content Memory (CM) is a library of all your content that you previously created or translated within Qordoba. If you have content that was translated previously outside of Qordoba, this is typically also commonly known as a "Translation Memory (TM)". 


#How do I create a new CM?

Once logged into Qordoba, you can create a new CM by clicking on "CM" at the top right of your browser. Click on "Create new" and fill in the prompts.

You have three ways of adding content to your CM: **link to addtoCM.md**

Option 1 - Add content segment by segment
Option 2 - Bulk upload existing content or TMs
Option 3 - Adding as you go from the Content Editor
