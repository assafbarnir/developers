#What is a Content Memory?

A Content Memory (CM) is a library of all your content that you previously created or translated within Qordoba. If you have content that was translated previously outside of Qordoba, this is typically also commonly known as a "Translation Memory (TM)". 


#How do I create a new CM?

Once logged into Qordoba, you can create a new CM by clicking on "CM" at the top right of your browser. Click on "Create new" and fill in the prompts.

You have three ways of adding content to your CM:

Option 1 - Add content segment by segment
Option 2 - Bulk upload existing content or TMs
Option 3 - Adding as you go from the Content Editor 


###Option 1 - Add content segment by segment

1. Open an existing CM and click on "Actions." Select "Add new segment."

2. Type in the new source and target content. Hit "Enter" on your keyboard to save.

3. Repeat Steps 1-2 if you have more segments to enter.


###Option 2 - Bulk upload existing content or TMs

If you have an existing content memory (CM) or translation memory (TM), you can easily upload it into Qordoba. Qordoba currently supports csv, tmx, and xliff files.

1. Click on "CM" at the top right of the page in Qordoba.

2. Click on "Create new" and add the following:

  - Name of CM
  - Select the Source Persona
  - Select the Target Persona
  - Description (optional)
  - Tags (optional)
  - Upload CM file

3. Click on "Next."

4. Using the drop-down fields, select the name of the column for source and target content. 

  - If you use keys, make sure to select "Yes" under "Do you have a column describing keys?" Map the name of the column that contains the keys.

5. Click on "Finish."

###Option 3 - Adding as you go from the Content Editor 
As you create and/or translate new content within Qordoba, it is automatically added the CM as your users complete and finalize it within the content editor
