#How do I know if a segment has a content memory match?

To find out if a segment has a content memory (CM) match, you will need to:

  1. Hover of the segment and check to see if SmartSuggest appears at 100%.

  2. Double click on the segment and look to the right sidebar.

In the side bar, you will see the CM match if there is one available. The % match indicates how close of a match the source content is to the the on in the CM.

In the example below, the source content is "Amazon Web Services (AWS)" and there is a 75% Match in the CM with "Amazon Web Services."
