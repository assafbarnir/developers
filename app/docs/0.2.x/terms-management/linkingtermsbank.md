#How do I link an existing workspace to an existing terms bank?

If you have Full Access permissions, head to the Settings tab in the left hand navigation bar in Qordoba. To the right of the persona you’d like to link the new content memory, click on the gear icon and select "Edit". A drop-down will appear under “Terms Bank” and you will be able to select your new terms bank from the dropdown to link to the workspace.

If unsaved segments in the existing workspace have terms that exist in the new terms bank, Qordoba will replace the existing SmartSuggest translations with what is in the new terms bank.

#How do I link a terms bank to a new workspace I'm creating?

During workspace creation, you will need to designate a terms bank for each target persona that you add to workspace. If you have an existing terms bank, it will appear in the drop-down. 

If you do not, you will need to create a new terms bank for the target persona. Click on "Create new" to the right of the drop-down.
