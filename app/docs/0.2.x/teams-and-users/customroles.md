#Custom Roles and permissions

If you are a Full Access user, you will be able to create new roles in addition to the default roles. This allows you to tailor the permissions to org users: for example, you might want to give different levels of permissions to guest content creators, such as contracted translators and editors, versus in-house linguists.

To create a new role, head over to “Roles” tab within your organization settings.

Click on “Add New Role” and name your role.

You now have the ability to modify permissions for 7 different sections (listed below) Toggling the slider to the right for each permission will enable the permission for your specific role:
