In Appearance->menus, you have to create one menu per language. Let’s say ‘menu_en’ and ‘menu_fr’, if you have a site in English and French.
In ‘menu_en’, you add English pages other menu items. In ‘menu_fr’, you add French pages and other menu items.
Then, once menus are both saved, you click on ‘manage locations’ tab and you assign ‘menu_en’ to ‘Primary menu English’ and ‘menu_ru’ to ‘Primary menu Français’.
