Qordoba's JavaScript SDK is the most advanced way to build an international audience or user base for your content. With the Qordoba JavaScript SDK, your team can translate, deploy and optimize content delivered to your users by market. Once installed, the SDK detects web content, including static and dynamic HTML, AJAX, JavaScript, SEO and images content, and allows you to edit and deploy these assets by locale within Qordoba. Your team can leverage in-context visual editor tools and workflow automation capabilities to make it easier to deploy content to +100 markets.

The JavaScript SDK is used to ingest content into Qordoba, but there are a number of options for how to deploy (ie, publish) the content your team creates via Qordoba.
* Publish to your users via the JavaScript SDK, which loads local content to the user at the time of browser loading. SEO and any localized images and design for your global pages is also delivered with the localized content. The SDK is flexible to support various domain configuration options, and can be hosted by you. No user information is passed through the SDK, and the SDK does not impact the loading times of your website. Read more about this option here.
* Sync the content created in Qordoba to your website/CMS/app via our API (text or HTML files)
* Download the strings created in Qordoba and upload to your website/CMS/app

Regardless of the publishing path chosen, the JavaScript SDK continues to monitor for new content on your source application and directs that content to the relevant team members via the workflows youâ€™ve set up. You can build workflows around what happens when new content is published in the source language, such as whether it goes live instantly or goes through an editing or review process.

The JavaScript SDK can ingest content from 3rd-party platforms, such as BigCommerce, Wordpress, Freshdesk, Hubspot, and Zendesk. To ingest content from a third-party CMS, paste the Qordoba JavaScript SDK in the HTML editing section of these apps (in a file usually called index file, layout file, HTMLHead.html, or in a section usually called code injection/custom code/head section HTML/custom JavaScript).
