All security bugs in Qordoba are taken seriously and should be reported by emailing [security@qordoba.com](mailto:security@qordoba.com). This will be delivered to a subset of the core team who handle security issues.

These updates will be sent at least every five days, in practice, this is more likely to be every 24-48 hours.

Security bugs in third party systems should be reported to their respective maintainers and can also be coordinated through the Qordoba Security email.
