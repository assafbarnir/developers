As companies increasingly use outside vendors to perform activities that are core to their business operations and strategy, there is a need for more trust and transparency into cloud software providers’ operations, processes and results.

The Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 verifies that Qordoba passed a rigorous audit of its internal controls, meeting the security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy standards set by American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). And beyond Type I compliance, Type II compliance means Qordoba passed an audit of our procedures/ controls over a period of 6 months.


#### What does this mean for your business? 

Along with the added rigor that SOC 2 requires, our SOC 2 Type I compliance means that you can communicate to your customers that your realtime app is built on a SOC 2 compliant infrastructure.

In addition to SOC 2 compliance, Qordoba has developed and maintains a suite of audited processes that reinforce the security of our service delivery environment:

- Data Encryption (in transit and at rest)
- HIPAA Compliance
- EU and US only Storage when required for PII data
- Intelligent Data Routing to lock and/or block data streams to specific regions
- US-EU Privacy Shield Framework Certified
- Compliance with the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (aka ‘Model Clauses’)
